Code for running the simulations in:
Mattingly, HH, Emonet, T. "Collective behavior and non-genetic inheritance allow bacterial populations to adapt to changing environments." (2022)

The .m files titled genParams... set up and run all simulations.

The folder "functions" contains all functions used to run simulations.

The folder "data" is where simulation data is saved.

The folder "analysisFuns" contains scripts and analysis data for generating the figure files, as well as all figure panels as raw images (.png and .svg).
